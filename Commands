Here are the basic commands to run and use your Ambedkar-GPT project from the GitHub repo you shared:

1. Clone the repo (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/piyushdalal8/Ambedkar-GPT.git
cd Ambedkar-GPT

2. Set up your Python environment

It's best to create a virtual environment first:

python -m venv venv
# Activate it:
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Build the vector database from the speech text file

This will chunk the speech, embed it, and store it in the vector DB:

python main.py --build --speech speech.txt

5. Ask a question

This command will query the vector DB and generate an answer using the LLM:

python main.py --ask "What did Ambedkar say about constitution?"


Replace the question inside the quotes with whatever you want to ask.

Optional: Serve a local server (if implemented) or run other scripts

Check your repo or code if you have commands to start a local API or web interface, but it looks CLI-based for now.
